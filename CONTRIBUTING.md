# Contributing Guidelines

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

Whether it's a bug report, new feature, correction, or additional documentation, we greatly value feedback and contributions from our community. THANK YOU!

We put together the handy guide below to help you get support for your work. Read on!  

## I Just Want to Ask a Question

For general help or discussion, join us in the [Kubernetes Slack team](https://kubernetes.slack.com/messages/CD4B15LUR/details/) channel `#linode`. To sign up, use the [Kubernetes Slack inviter](http://slack.kubernetes.io/).

The [Linode Community](https://www.linode.com/community/questions/) is a great place to get additional support.

## How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report or Feature Request

Please open a [github issue](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/) to report bugs or suggest features.

When filing an issue or feature request, help us avoid duplication and redundant effort -- check existing open or recently closed issues first. 

Detailed bug reports and requests easier for us to work with. Please include the following in your issue:

* A reproducible test case or series of steps
* The version of our code being used
* Any modifications you've made, relevant to the bug
* Anything unusual about your environment or deployment
* Screenshots and code samples where illustrative and helpful

## How to Open a Pull Request

We follow the [fork and pull model](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) for open source contributions.

Tips for a faster merge:
 * address one feature or bug per pull request. 
 * large formatting changes make it hard for us to focus on your work.
 * follow language coding conventions.
 * make sure that tests pass.
 * make sure your commits are atomic, [addressing one change per commit](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/). 
 * add tests!
